Backend changes are truncated too early to verify REQ-13/REQ-14 implementation, and the hooks file is truncated so REQ-16 cannot be fully confirmed.",

      "reason": "ParentDashboardPage renders the \"Become Parent Admin\" button whenever `isAdmin` is false, without any query/check for whether an admin exists (no backend-indicated gating is present in the shown code).",
